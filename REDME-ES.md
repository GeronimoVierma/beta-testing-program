## Introducción 

El programa de Fermat "Beta Testing Program" es una red de testers distribuidos en algunos equipos de trabajo. Cada equipo se reunirá 2 horas por dia via Hangouts, (programa de video llamada de Google) el lider del equipo guiará los casos de testeo. Estas reuniones serán publicas y podran ser grabadas como tambien reproducidas via youtube para futuros analisis de los casos de Testing.


<br>

Team Leader: Undefined (github: Undefined)

<br>
## Procedure

One hour before the daily meeting, the testing team leader will instruct team members about which APK (mobile APP) to download and install or how to update their current installation. Team members will join the meeting and will follow the team leader's instructions on what to test during that session is going to be about.

Team members will report any problem found during their tests by opening a github issue in this same repository (in a very similar way you created a new issue to sign up for the program), and completing a test report template. They will add screenshots captured by their device to the issue to show what they were seing at the moment. 

The issues found will be discussed aloud and would be reproduced by other team members online. Other team members will follow up the issue with their own comments, screenshots or whatever information they believe is relevant to solve the problem. 

In the same issue, developer team leaders and / or developer team members will be tagged in order for them to be hooked into the issue and possibly ask for more information. If the hangout session is not over they might join the conference call for a while in order to gather knowledge in real time. Finally, they will create their own issues in their own repository detailing the things that must be done by their own team.

### Reporting an Issue

In this repository you will report an Issue every time you find something that is not working fine. The procedure to do so is the following:

#### Report a Possible Bug

-- write procedure here considering is going to be done from a mobile phone--

#### Follow up a Reported Bug

-- write here the follow up procedure --

### Bounty Program

Developers teams usually are rewarded a bounty when they finish a project on time. These bounties are governed by the [Fermat Bounty Program](https://github.com/bitDubai/bounty-program).

When developers finish programming their software enter in what is called Alpha phase, were they correct bugs and polish their work. After they pass functionality tests their software enters the Beta phase and at that point is when you start testing their software. 

Everyday you will test their software and find bugs (something that doesn't work well) that they will correct and you will test again. 

Usually they are awarded their bounty when their code reaches Alpha stage, but their bounty is not payed until it reaches Release state. That means that while you are finding bugs on their code they don't get paid and as Fermat tokens value raises month over month, they will get less tokens if time passes and they don't reach Release state. That is an incentive for them to produce software without problems. 

You as a tester will have the opposite incentive. If you prevent their software to reach Release state by finding a lot of the problems (bugs) the software have, you will be awarded a bounty proportional to the time you prevented their software to reach release state.

Your bounty will be equal to the difference between the amount of tokens developers would receive at the date of entering Alpha, and the amount of tokens they finally receive entering the Release phase.

All those tokens will be splitted between all the teams testing that APP. You will freely agree between team leaders and members how to split the bounty case by case.

The amount everyone receives will be recorded at the document representing the proyect being tested. An example of such a document can be find [here](https://github.com/bitDubai/bounty-program/blob/master/bounties/Digital-Asset-Platform.md).
